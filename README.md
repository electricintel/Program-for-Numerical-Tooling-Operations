<p>An early pioneer in the fields of NC and CAD/CAM software, Patrick J. Hanratty, PhD, discovered his passion for computing and programming almost by accident, answering a newspaper ad seeking programmers in his hometown of San Diego after returning from service in the Air Force during the Korean War. After being hired at General Dynamic’s Convair Division, Hanratty picked up programming quickly, heading up a class on the topic without any formal training. Often lauded as “The Father of CAD/CAM” for his later inventions of CAD/CAM software programs, while working at General Electric in 1957, Hanratty developed PRONTO, or Program for Numerical Tooling, an early NC programming software, along with MTD, the Machine Tool Director, the first two NC programs for machine tools used in production manufacturing.</p>
<p>In 1962, Hanratty left GE to join General Motors Corp. (Detroit), where he was part of a team at the GM Research Laboratories, located at the automaker’s Tech Center (Warren, MI). At GM, Hanratty developed graphics for GM’s DAC (Design Augmented by Computers) project while working on experimental machining, solving problems involving three, four, and five-axis surface machining. After leaving GM, in 1970 Hanratty started Integrated Computer Systems (ICS) where he and his team developed a CAD/CAM system for Redcor minicomputers using TPL (The Programming Language). While highly regarded, the ICS INTERAPT software didn’t become a commercial success, leading Hanratty to found another company, Manufacturing Consulting Services Inc. (MCS) in 1971 that developed a new machine-independent software called ADAM (Automated Drafting and Machining), which at that time was said to be the only commercially available drafting and machining system. MCS went on to develop more mechanical CAD and manufacturing software, first with its AD-2000 package and later with the PC and UNIX-based ANVIL CAD/CAM systems.</p>

<p>Today, Hanratty, 79, continues working on programming problems related to CAD/CAM and manufacturing. In particular, he sees no real innovation in CAD/CAM since the debut of Parametric Technology Corp.’s (Needham, MA) parametric Pro/Engineer CAD/CAM package back in 1988, and Hanratty forecasts trouble ahead for manufacturers. He contends that current and future CAD/CAM systems will be unable to provide the precision required to accurately create the components required by mission-critical aerospace/defense applications. In an exclusive interview with <em>Manufacturing Engineering</em>, Hanratty discussed his career in manufacturing research and the CAD/CAM world.</p>
<p><strong>Manufacturing Engineering:</strong> Tell me about your early years. How did you get started in programming?</p>
<p><strong>Patrick Hanratty:</strong> At the very start, when I came out of the service, I had no idea what I was going to do, since I was trained to be a singer before that. My vocal chords and lungs were scarred as the result of a B-29 crash I survived. I had to find another profession. One of the classes I had to take, as a remote-control turret gunner, was a computer course. Computers in those days meant analog computers. When I saw the ad in the San Diego newspaper ‘Wanted, Computer Programmers’ at Convair, General Dynamics’ division in San Diego, I decided I’d give it a chance. I was lucky enough to get hired as a programmer trainee, and sat in a class which, at the end of three days, I was asked to take over. The IBM instructor teaching the course had all the manuals, but she had no idea what programming was conceptually, and I had an idea almost instantly.</p>
<p>Here I am at Convair, and the very first thing I had to do was the section properties—bending stresses and shear flow for a multi-celled aircraft. The program was successful, but it was pretty interesting because initially I had had no mathematics for the project, but fortunately I was a quick study. This was 1954, 1955. My next assignment was the program for doing field-length takeoff calculations—when an engine goes out on a plane during takeoff, the pilot must determine if takeoff can continue or be aborted. So this was my experience in programming. The IBM 650 was the first machine I worked on. And, in parallel with that, I learned how to program the Univac Scientific 1103-A from Sperry Rand. I loved programming that machine—it was like a toy!</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Where did you go next?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> A sequence of things made me kind of successful when I joined General Electric, which ran an ad in the paper saying they were starting a computer company in Phoenix. I applied for a job, and in January of ’57 I was hired as the seventh employee here in Phoenix for GE’s computer department. I had three big assignments out of GE. One was the IRMA project, the MICR magnetic character reader. What we had to do was come up with the character set that could be read in with heavy ink or light ink, fast or slow, or skewed a little bit, or crumpled. I wrote a program that would analyze each character set. That program was then run against each of the character sets that had been submitted by a large number of GE employees, and the character set, which is currently on your checks today, is the one that popped out as the best to use. It was accepted by the Bank of America, and several months later the American Banking Association accepted it as the standard for MICR characters on checks.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> When did you get involved in NC programming?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> That would be ’57–’58 when I developed PRONTO, Program for Numerical Tooling Operations. What I did was develop the instruction set on how to control a Milwaukee-Matic [Kearney &amp; Trecker; West Allis, WI]. Then, the next assignment at GE was developing the MTD, the Machine Tool Director software; PRONTO was a 2½ axis, and the MTD was full three axis. To my knowledge, since APT wasn’t in production at that point, I believe that was the first commercial pair of NC programs that existed.</p>

<figcaption class="c007">Surface models in Patrick Hanratty's ANVIL-5000 software from MCS included both wireframe and shaded versions.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Those programs came before APT [Automatically Programmed Tool] by Doug Ross?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> Doug Ross was the principal, as far as APT was concerned. It was a team headed up by Doug Ross, and the principal companies were Boeing and GE. There were altogether about eight or nine companies that worked very closely together. APT was started before the GE computer department was formed, and continued to grow over several years, but it was not a commercial product per se.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> What did PRONTO do for the Milwaukee-Matic?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> It was a 2½-axis CAM system language that allowed programmers to produce the tool movements for machining parts. It generated a punch-paper tape to control the machine, and it won the Joseph Marie Jacquard Memorial Award [in 1982 from the Numerical Control Society].</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> You’re described as the Father of CAD/CAM. How did you get started in CAD?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> When I went to GM, I was part of the DAC project, and I was responsible for both the machining output and any drafting output—our drafting machine consisted of a Giddings &amp; Lewis [Fond du Lac, WI] milling machine. It had a big linoleum-covered table with the vacuum pumps behind it, with little holes, sheets of mylar to draw on, and with a ballpoint pen in the place of the tool. And that was, as far as I know, the first mechanical drafting capability. That was the first thing I did at GM in 1962.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> What did you do at GM that advanced part manufacturing?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> OK, there are several things. One of the largest was the creation of a mathematical surface approximation so that a five-axis milling machine could be used to effectively make any shape. I had done some experimental machining at GM. The five-axis world was one that really interested me, and I came up with an algorithm, a way of simulating the sculpted surface with contiguous developable surfaces.</p>
<p>When the developable surface concept was presented, a mathematics professor at one of the universities GM consulted with told GM not to spend any research money on that approximation approach—it wasn’t feasible. I was at a meeting with Fisher Body, which at that time was responsible for the die models for all cars; they had this one cube, and had no way of getting it turned into a die model. I said ‘Hey, I can do that! I’ve been doing some experimental machining at Numac in Cleveland, with their five-axis milling machine. I know that I can get that deck lid done—I tell you what, I’ll bet my job on it.’ I had one assistant go with me to Numac. When we got there I found out all my surface normals were going in the wrong direction. I did a couple of tests and I reprogrammed the output, changing the normals—and finally got it working! We had to cut part of the toolchanger off from this gigantic machine, because the model was so big. I hadn’t been to sleep for more than a total of three hours in the previous seven days, but we got the model finished. Afterwards, when we took it to the research center, the Fisher Body engineer measuring it said that it was the most accurate, finest model produced by General Motors Corp. in the 45 years he’d worked there. He couldn’t measure any differences—it was a perfect model.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> You founded MCS in 1971, which developed ADAM for automated drafting, and the AD-2000 software package, which was said to cement your CAD/CAM reputation. Please tell us about this period in your career.</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> ADAM was the first MCS product. It was an integrated drafting and numerical control system. MCS licensed ADAM to Computervision [CADDS], Gerber Scientific [IDS 3], Tektronix [Teknicad], and United Computing [Unigraphics]. The second MCS product, four years after ADAM, was AD-2000. This moved MCS software from a 16-bit word only system to an integrated CAD/CAM system for 24-bit, 32-bit, 48-bit, and 60-bit computers. AD-2000 was licensed to Autotrol [AD380], Control Data [CD-2000], and Kongsberg [CDM-300]. NASA also licensed AD-2000, which they named NASA IPAD [Integrated Program for Aerospace Design]. MCS had many thousands of customers all over the world. Caterpillar tractor, for instance, bought the source code, so they could use it throughout their entire Caterpillar system. This happened with dozens of large companies worldwide. There isn’t a company that I can think of that we didn’t have at least a few seats in.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> Some observers say that 70% of 3-D mechanical CAD systems can be traced to your original code.</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> At one time, it was 100%. When we sold an ADAM license to United Computing, MCS and United Computing named it Unigraphics, because United Computing had a product called UniApt, and they wanted to have our package to go with that. So Unigraphics was purchased from MCS by United Computing, and of course, McDonnell-Douglas bought it and expanded it.</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> You said that there has been no real innovation in CAD since PTC announced its parametric Pro/Engineer; why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> Parametric Technologies came out with Pro/Engineer in 1988, and that was the first heavily marketed parametric solid modeler. Before long, everyone was convinced that they had to have parametric solid modeling. Up to that time, the MCS solid modeler, OMNISOLIDS, was the strongest solid-modeling package in the world, and MCS won every competition when it came up for a comparison between it and other solid modelers. Unfortunately, OMNISOLIDS was not parametric, and we pulled it from the marketplace, and two years later, we put old OMNISOLIDS down!</p>
<p><strong>ME:</strong> You’re also concerned about current and future CAD systems’ capability to meet accuracy required by precision manufacturing in aerospace/defense. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Hanratty:</strong> The current design systems don’t have enough accuracy because they are limited to 64-bit floating point in design calculations. There is 128-bit capability in both modern computers and modern programming languages available right now. If CAD companies want to move from the 20th century into today, they can produce a new system using today’s technology, a very large addressing space from the 64-bit chips and 128-bit precision—quad precision—to accurately make the 21st century items that are in the minds of today’s designer.</p>
<p>What we’ve done is exhaust what we have in the way of design resources, as far as our surface and solid-modeling world is concerned. Over the past two years, 2008 and 2009, I have talked with most, if not all, the software officers of the major CAD companies. They have all indicated that they are not planning to take the next step that is needed for future design and manufacturing tolerances.</p>
<p>What’s needed is a CAD surface/solid modeling kernel that will function within all the major CAD and CAM systems, offering double-precision in and out, with all processing in quadruple precision, and an effectively ‘unlimited’ object size, for example, blending two free-form surfaces, each over 100-m long, within a micron tolerance.</p>

Interest-ingly, they began to emerge from the laboratory at roughly the same time in the early 1960s. And in the case of CAM, the technology was actually numerical control machining, which later grew into what we know today as computer-aided manufacturing. </p><p>At their introduction and for a long time afterward, probably no one could foresee that CAD and CAM would become intertwined and emerge as the most powerful forces in the industrial world. In fact, many people in industry thought that neither technology was destined to have much of an economic impact. </p><p>In the case of CAD, there were a number of people and institutions working on the idea of computer graphics for design. But the individual generally accorded to have been first with the most is Dr. Ivan Sutherland, who did his seminal work with a system called Sketchpad at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Parallel work was being done at the General Motors Research Laboratories. </p><p>The origins of numerical control or CAM were clearly with Mr. John Parsons, who owned a firm that produced a number of products but who did his original work in NC in conjunction with manufacturing helicopter rotor blades. Development of numerical control subsequently became largely an effort sponsored by the Air Force with work done by MIT. </p><p>One of the people involved with the General Motors CAD project was Dr. Patrick Hanratty, who later left GM to form his own company and develop the first commercially available software for mechanical drafting. Dr. Hanratty's software was used as the basis for nearly a dozen start-up companies selling turnkey CAD programs. Today, an estimated 90% of commercial drafting software can trace its roots back to Dr. Hanratty's original program, called Adam. </p><p>A quarter century ago, the very idea of CAD and CAM being linked was far-fetched and provocative to say the least. But today, production of a part is set in motion from a designer's graphic terminal. </p><p>What CAD and CAM now constitute is one of the greatest technological and economic forces ever seen in industry. Unfortunately, this fact is not comprehended by the public at large. Outside of the manufacturing and design engineering communities, few people realize how instrumental CAD and CAM are in establishing our standard of living at unprecedented heights. </p><p>The combined technologies need a Pantheon where landmark events and the people responsible for them can be honored and remembered. To this end, a CAD-CAM Hall of Fame has been established. Dr. Ivan Sutherland, Mr. John Parsons, and Dr. Patrick Hanratty are the first inductees. AMERICAN MACHINIST'S sister publication MACHINE DESIGN is handing out the honors. </p><p><b>Patrick J.

Hanratty's pioneering contributions to CAD/CAM technology date back to 1957 when he developed software for Pronto, the first commercial NC programming language, while working at General Electric. Soon after, he devised a set of standardized machine-readable characters for use on bank checks. <p></p><p>That standard was accepted by the American Banking Association and is still in use today. At the same time, he began dabbling in computer-generated graphics, a largely unexplored field at the time. </p><p>In 1961 he moved on to General Motors Research Laboratories where he helped develop DAC, (Design Automated by Computer), the first CAD/CAM system to use interactive graphics. Hanratty's efforts in the project concentrated on the NC and graphics portion of the overall system. Although DAC was said to be incredibly useful and unparalleled in the auto industry for designing complex die molds, GM discarded the system when it upgraded its hardware and abandoned the software written for its older computers. </p><p>In 1970, Hanratty started his own company, ICS to write and market a CAD/CAM drafting package. Unfortunately, he targeted the software to run on a machine few people had heard of, and wrote it in TPL, his own programming language that even fewer people knew. Needless to say, the company was less than a success. But it did teach Hanratty some important lessons that are just as valid today: "Never generate anything closely coupled to a specific architecture. And make sure you keep things open to communicate with other systems, even your competitors." </p><p>He disbanded ICS and went on to form a new company, Manufacturing and Consulting Services (MCS) in 1971. Working alone, he wrote Adam, the first commercially available integrated, interactive graphics design, drafting, and manufacturing system. And this time he wrote it in Fortran and designed it to run on virtually any machine. </p><p>The package was a success. He eventually upgraded it to run on 16-bit, then 32-bit computers. He added more machining and surfacing capabilities and eventually rechristened it AD-2000. Even today, many major CAD/CAM companies can trace their software back to code written by Hanratty for Adam, AD-2000, and its follow-on Anvil-4000. Adam, for example, was licensed by Computervision Corp. for Cadds, by Gerber Scientific Inc. for IDS 3, and McDonnell Douglas for Unigraphics. </p><p>Some of the innovative firsts that sprung from MCS include Auto-Grapl and Autosnap 3D, along with Anvil-5000, a full-featured mainframe and workstation CADCAM system that works on PCs without a reduction in capabilities. Intelligent Modeler, a relational/parametric solid modeler that is fully integrated with a complete CAM system, also has its roots in MCS. </p><p>Autosnap 3D lets computer users automatically create 3D solid models from a 2D drawing. Auto-Grapl lets engineers design components, view the geometry, then command the system to write a program, in Grapl, that would make the part using NC machining. "We wanted a set of programs that would let the computer write its own program," says Hanratty. "And from a customer's point of view, Auto-Grapl is the most significant advance to date in the CAD/CAM industry, or for that matter, in any area of computer science — the computer writes the program for you." </p><p><b>John T.

Parsons' skill and innovation first surfaced during World War II when his company produced weapons. By 1946, however, Parsons Corp. was making rotor blades for helicopters. Parsons developed programs that would use IBM punch card accounting machines to solve complex problems in structural and aerodynamic blade design. By 1947, he had devised a method in which milling machine operators turned out airfoil templates using a chart of table and cutter settings prepared on IBM punch-card machines. And by 1949, he had begun designing a punch-card system that would totally control a milling machine, the first "numerically controlled" machine, which would be used to make wing panels for a new Lockheed bomber. In 1969, he adapted numerical control to the making of polystyrene foundry patterns for cast-metal machine tool bases. The same process was soon being used by automakers worldwide for casting body dies faster and less expensively. <p></p><p>During his long and productive life, he has also developed a host of manufacturing and management techniques that are efficient and safe. In 1950, for example, he conceived and built a modular tooling system using sockets in the floor to install a two-point fixture suspension. It saved floor space and fixture costs, while promoting worker safety. In the same year, he designed and directed the installation of four traveling-column straightening presses, believed to be the first in the world. </p><p>Parsons also made significant contributions to the aviation industry, especially in the area of composites. He pioneered the use of adhesive bonding for metal aircraft components, and used it on 22-ft-long rotor blades. In 1958, his company turned out composite blades for helicopter rotors and wind tunnels, as well as 55-ft-diameter geodesic domes. By 1960, he had begun working on an all-composite airplane, which flew in 1966 on variable-camber wings equipped with boundary layer control. Parsons also helped the U.S. reach the moon, designing and building large (20-in.-diameter, 40-ft-long) fuel lines for Saturn V booster rockets. </p><p><b>Ivan E.

It let designers use a lightpen to create engineering drawings directly on a CRT. The drawings could also be manipulated, duplicated, and stored. Sketchpad opened the door to graphic computing and included such features as computer memory to store drawn objects, rubber-banding for simpler line construction, the ability to zoom in or out on a display, and techniques for making perfect lines, corners, and joints. It was the first graphic user interface (GUI) long before the term was coined. Sutherland also helped develop the first algorithms that removed "hidden lines" in 3D drawings, essential in generating realistic renderings for CAD models. </p><p>As an associate professor at Harvard in 1967, Sutherland and a student, Bob Sproull, modified an existing system in which a helicopter pilot positioned a camera by moving his head. Sutherland and Sproull's new "Head-mounted Display" invention let viewers see and navigate through a computer-generated 3D environment. It was some of the first work done in virtual reality technology and would have far reaching implications. </p><p>In 1968, Sutherland joined with David Evans to form Evans &amp; Sutherland, a company which today is one of the premier developers and manufacturers of computer imaging systems. It is also the leading supplier of visual simulation equipment used for aircraft pilot training. The firm revolutionized computer visualization and modeling, the cornerstones of CAD/CAM. </p><p>As head of the Computer Science Dept. at the California Institute of Technology from 1976 to 1980, Sutherland, along with Professor Carver Mead, introduced integrated circuit (IC) design to academia. Until then, IC design took place only in a few industrial companies. Universities found it too difficult or too mundane to teach. Sutherland and Mead deserve much of the credit for making IC design a proper field of study. This approach has turned out a generation of IC designers who have accelerated chip technology and created the very foundation for Silicon Valley. </p><p>Today, Sutherland conducts research at Sun Microsystems Laboratories where he is busy developing a concept he calls Asynchronous Systems, a project intended to break the mold of "traditional" thought on computer design.</p></div></section></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>While it might be tempting to think of <strong>Computer Aided Design</strong> as a relatively recent innovation, most CAD programs we use today can actually be traced back to work begun <strong>over 50 years</strong> <strong>ago</strong>. As such, CAD has had a long and rich history that spans back decades. If, however, you’re not familiar with the history of CAD, you’re in luck.</p>
<p>Scan2CAD has put together a complete guide covering the&nbsp;<strong>beginnings of CAD</strong> in the 1950s, how CAD evolved <strong>after 1982</strong>, and <a href="https://www.scan2cad.com/news/solid-edge-2019-…nuous-release-nx/">what the <strong>future</strong> might hold for CAD</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>History of CAD</strong></h1>
<p><a name="before-1982"></a></p>
<h2>CAD Before 1982</h2>
<h2><strong>The Beginning of CAD</strong></h2>
<p>During World War&nbsp;II, computing underwent a lot of development. Patrick Hanratty, “the father of CAD/CAM”, developed&nbsp;<strong>PRONTO</strong> (Program for Numerical Tooling Operations) the first CNC programming system, in 1957. In fact, some <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/community/news/spotlight/spotlight_hanratty.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">industry analysts</a> estimate that 70% of all 3D mechanical CAD/CAM systems available today can trace their roots back to Hanratty’s original code.</p>
<p>Not long after, Ivan Sutherland developed <strong>Sketchpad</strong> in 1963 as part of his thesis at MIT—titled ‘Sketchpad, A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System’. Users could interact with the program through a screen, a light pen to draft and a set of buttons to set parameters or constraints. The program overall was primitive in design by today’s standards, but it was highly complex for its time. While it never became commercially available, it did pave the way for later CAD software.&nbsp;More developments arose in the 1960s, including the first <strong>digitizer</strong> from <strong>Auto-trol</strong>, and <strong>DAC-1</strong>, the first production interactive graphics manufacturing system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this video we’re introduced to Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad</p>

<p>The start of the 1970s saw research slowly turn from 2D towards 3D. Milestones in this research include Versprille’s <strong>NURBS</strong> invention, which formed the basis for modern 3D curve and surface modeling, and the development of <strong>PADL</strong> (Part and Assembly Description Language) by Grayer, Lang and Braid. <strong>ADAM</strong>, a CAD software used as a basis for commercial CAD software systems, was released in 1972. <strong>CATIA</strong> (Computer-Aided Three Dimensional Interactive Application) was released later in 1977, bringing engineers into the world of 3D modeling.</p>
<h2><strong>Setting The Stage For Large-Scale Adoption</strong></h2>
<p>The emergence of <strong>UNIX workstations</strong> in the 1980s truly revolutionized the computing and CAD markets. A mere decade or two earlier, CAD software was a proprietary tool for heavy industries. By the 1980s, however, commercial CAD systems began to appear in the aerospace, automotive and shipbuilding industries. It was the introduction of the first <strong>IBM PC</strong> in 1981 that truly marked the beginning of the large-scale adoption of CAD.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="caption-attachment-18517" class="wp-caption-text">Back in 1982, AutoCAD was sold on floppy disks! (Source: Autodesk.blogs.com)</p></div>
<p>The same year saw&nbsp;the release of two solid modeling packages,&nbsp;<strong>Romulus</strong> and <strong>Uni-Solid</strong>, both of which enabled users to see exactly what their design would look like in real life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following year marked an even bigger milestone in CAD history—the founding of <strong>Autodesk</strong> and subsequent release of <strong>AutoCAD</strong>, the first significant CAD program for the IBM PC. It was a huge success for Autodesk, with AutoCAD&nbsp;winning “The Best CAD Product” award from PC World magazine in 1986 and continuing to do so for the next 10 years. From this point on, increasingly advanced drafting and engineering functionality became more affordable.</p>

<h1><strong>Post-1982</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>The CAD Revolution</strong></h2>
<p>AutoCAD was revolutionary—setting the pace for the development of other CAD competitors. However, CAD software was still predominantly 2D-based. This all changed in 1987 with the release of <strong>Pro/ENGINEER</strong>. This program was based on solid geometry and parametric techniques for defining parts and assemblies. It ran on UNIX workstations, as PCs still didn’t have the capabilities required by CAD programs. This was a game-changer, making the user interfaces of other CAD programs obsolete. Engineers were now able to set clear <strong>parameters</strong>, <strong>features</strong> and <strong>relationships</strong>. The only thing that set back the pace of parametric modeling at this time&nbsp;was the difficulty with investing time and money in training, and converting legacy data from other CAD programs to Pro/ENGINEER’s proprietary data format.</p>
<p>The end of the 1980s brought about the struggle between 3D CAD software developers, all trying to match Pro/ENGINEER’s user interface and capabilities. This paved the way for 3D solid modeling kernels, like <strong>Parasolid</strong> and <strong>ACIS</strong>, which were later integrated into new parametric CAD programs. Parasolid was developed by Shape Data Limited for&nbsp;other companies to&nbsp;license for use in their own 3D CAD&nbsp;products. ACIS, developed by Spatial, was sold to many 3D CAD software vendors—most notably AutoCAD, who licensed the kernel in 1990.</p>
<p>The commercialization of CAD software and the decline in proprietary software led to difficulty amongst CAD developers in differentiating their software from each other’s. This decline in proprietary software also led to the rise in aerospace and automotive manufacturers buying CAD software from commercial vendors. <strong>Boeing</strong>, for example, announced in 1988 that <strong>CATIA</strong> would be used to design and draft the new 777 aircraft. This created <strong>$1 billion</strong> in revenue for <strong>IBM-Dassault</strong>.</p>

<h2><strong><br>
 The 1990s: PCs, PLM and the Internet</strong></h2>
<p>By the 1990s,&nbsp;the <strong>PC</strong> was finally capable of the computations that&nbsp;3D CAD required. This led to turmoil for the UNIX workstations. While many users required the CPU power provided by UNIX workstations, many were far more satisfied with the performance of PCs. This move from UNIX to PC was transformational. CAD software slowly started to become accessible to millions of engineers and consumers who previously couldn’t afford the technology.</p>
<p>In 1995, the first significant modeler for Windows was released—<strong>SolidWorks</strong>. It was so successful that after just 2 years, <strong>Dassault Systèmes</strong> acquired it in 1997 for $320 million. <strong>Solid Edge</strong>, a program based on ACIS, was released&nbsp;later that year. The following year saw the release of Autodesk’s <strong>Mechanical Desktop</strong>—their first 3D solid modeling product—which quickly became the number one selling 3D CAD software in the world. Autodesk continued their success with their release of <strong>Autodesk Inventor</strong> in 1999.</p>

<p>Most 3D CAD programs by the end of the 1990’s had reached the same point—all offering similar features.&nbsp;The push for new innovations in the world of 3D CAD finally started to slow down. Instead, interest was now directed at <strong>product data management</strong>&nbsp;software, which had been successfully used in Boeing’s 777 paperless design with CATIA. A great deal of energy was also spent on the struggle to become “<strong>Internet-enabled</strong>“, with the main focus upon enabling users to view 3D CAD models in web browsers.</p>
<p>By the end of the decade, amongst the decline in technological innovations, many original CAD developers from the 1960s had been acquired by newer, larger companies. These companies eventually consolidated into four main competitors: <strong>Autodesk</strong>, <strong>Dassault Systèmes</strong>, <strong>PTC</strong> and <strong>UGS</strong> (now Siemens PLM).</p>

<h1><strong>CAD in the 21st Century</strong></h1>
<h2><strong>The Growth of CAD Software and the Internet</strong></h2>
<p>The beginning of the 21st century marked the release of client-side CAD tools and web-enabled CAD. <strong>Alibre</strong> released <strong>Alibre Design</strong> in 2000, as the first 3D CAD software able to perform client-server 3D modeling over the Internet. Autodesk subsequently released <strong>AutoCAD 2000i</strong>, which was their first web-enabled CAD software. Autodesk continued its success into the 21st century with constant updates to its popular AutoCAD product, including <strong>tool palettes</strong> in 2003, <strong>dynamic block functioning</strong> in 2005 and support for <strong>Macs</strong> in 2011.</p>
<p>The next decade also saw the growth of other popular CAD programs—<strong>Revit</strong>, <strong>Creo</strong>, <strong>SolidWorks</strong> and many more.</p>

<h2><strong>PDM and PLM</strong></h2>
<p>While the last two decades involved the race for innovations in 3D CAD, the beginning of the 21st century brought about a period of <strong>sustainability</strong> in CAD software. Rather than bring forth new, innovative software, vendors were now&nbsp;interested in <strong>product data management</strong> (<strong>PDM</strong>)—trying to reduce concept, design and manufacturing time. Ford’s release of the <strong>Ford Mondeo</strong> proved this was possible in late 2000. The Ford Mondeo was designed over the Internet using Ford’s <strong>C3P</strong> (CAD/CAM/CAE/PDM) platform, in a third of the time traditionally required. This success proved that the integration of CAD software, PDM and the Internet could give designers and engineers the perfect way to collaborate and create in a time-efficient and convenient manner. Vendors found that using <strong>PDM</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>PLM</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>product lifecycle management</strong>)&nbsp;would therefore eliminate prolonged development times and increase workflow.&nbsp;</p>

<h1><strong>Availability of CAD</strong></h1>
<p><a name="growth-in-technology"></a></p>
<h2><strong>Growth in Technology&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>The 21st century also brought about another evolution in the computing platform. With the introduction of PCs, smartphones and tablets on a large scale, CAD became available on cloud, web and mobile technologies. It’s now possible for engineers to work with CAD on any <strong>Mac</strong>, <strong>Windows PC</strong> or<strong> tablet</strong>. Of course, the availability of CAD also brought about an increased use of this software by the consumer public.</p>
<p>Nowadays, CAD systems are compatible with all the major platforms—<strong>Windows</strong>, <strong>Linux</strong>, <strong>UNIX</strong> and <strong>Mac OS X</strong>. Some systems even support multiple platforms. They don’t require special hardware, unless you’re using a CAD program that involves intensive tasks—then you might need high-speed CPUs and large amounts of RAM. This is a far cry from the early days of CAD.</p>
<p>In addition, the interaction between human and machine has altered. Typically, designers make use of a <strong>computer mouse</strong> with CAD programs. However, designers can also make use of&nbsp;a <strong>pen</strong> and <strong>digitizing graphics tablet</strong>. Furthermore, there’s been a lot of development in the CAD-human interface interaction—from <strong>touchscreens</strong> to <strong>VR/AR</strong>. This will be discussed in the <strong>CAD and the Future</strong> section.</p>
<p>Now, onto the different types of CAD available…</p>
<h2><strong>2D CAD Programs</strong></h2>
<p>These programs create ‘<strong>flat</strong>‘ drawings of products or structures. These drawings are made up of lines, circles, curves and so on. The programs will often include libraries of models, Bezier curves, splines and polylines. There are different ‘levels’ of 2D CAD programs. Some are free and open source; typically these programs are more simplistic, without the difficulties of scaling or placements. Examples of 2D CAD freeware include <a href="https://qcad.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QCAD</a> and <a href="https://librecad.org/cms/home.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibreCAD</a>.</p>
<p>There are of course, the more complex ‘high-end’ programs—the most recognizable of which is <a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/autocad/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AutoCAD</a>.</p>

<p>3D CAD systems essentially create a <strong>realistic model</strong> of what your design may look like in the real world. They’re useful for aiding designers in finding flaws that they might have otherwise missed. These programs can be&nbsp;split into two types: parametric modelers and direct/explicit modelers. There is 3D wireframe and&nbsp;the incorporation of 3D ‘dumb’ solids into programs like AutoCAD—you can learn more about that <a href="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Computer-aided_design" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parametric modelin</strong><strong>g</strong> requires designers to use “<strong>design intent</strong>“. This means that they have to think of the design as a real world representation of the object—changes can, or cannot be made, the same way changes would or wouldn’t be made to a real world object. Parametric modeling therefore requires the designer to think and plan ahead—considering every action.</p>
<p><strong>Direct or explicit modeling</strong> gives designers the ability to edit geometry without a history tree. Essentially, designers can quickly create 3D designs which they can then modify through direct interactions with the model geometry.</p>
<p>Some popular 3D CAD programs include <a href="https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/inventor/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Autodesk Inventor</a>, <a href="https://www.solidworks.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SolidWorks</a> and <a href="https://www.ptc.com/cad/creo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PTC Creo</a>.</p>

The availability of CAD in the 21st century was undoubtedly aided by the trend of <strong><a href="https://www.scan2cad.com/cad/will-cloud-impact-cad/">cloud-based CAD</a></strong>. It was first mentioned by a major company in 2010, when SolidWorks featured it at their <a href="https://www.cadalyst.com/sww2010" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World 2010</a> event. It then took a several years for cloud-based CAD to become a mainstream topic in the CAD industry. This trend has since helped to change the way the entire CAD industry works. With cloud-based CAD, designers across the world can simultaneously work on a CAD model.&nbsp;Autodesk jumped on board this trend with their release of <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/students-teachers-educators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fusion 360</a> in 2013. This was closely followed by <a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onshape</a>‘s eponymous product in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The availability brought about by the Internet and cloud-based CAD led to the spread in use of CAD software across industries. Originally, CAD was predominantly used in heavy industries alone. Nowadays, however, you would struggle to find an industry that doesn’t use it.&nbsp;Check out a few examples of industries using CAD below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mechanical engineering</li>
<li>AEC sector</li>
<li>Aerospace</li>
<li>Fashion</li>
<li>Industrial design</li>
<li>Entertainment</li>
<li>Computer Graphic Animation (CGA)</li>
<li>Civil Engineering</li>
<li>Machinery</li>
<li>Medicine</li>
</ul>
<p>This rise in use of CAD has increased over the years. In fact, virtually no product today is created without the use of CAD software—through <strong>design</strong>, <strong>simulation</strong> and <strong>manufacturing</strong>. CAD’s importance also brought about the breach of CAD skills into the career sector. If you’re in any design sector, you’ll see many advertised&nbsp;jobs that require CAD skills. Skills in many different CAD programs are highly valued, be it in&nbsp;<strong>AutoCAD</strong>, <strong>SolidWorks</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Revit</strong>, or one of the myriad of available programs.

&nbsp;<strong>Errors are still possible</strong>. Despite how much CAD has evolved and how sophisticated many programs are, it’s still possible to make errors.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it’s clear to see why CAD was adopted across so many industries. Virtually everything in the modern world is created using CAD technology, because its design process is so sleek and so powerful.&nbsp;Obviously, the pros and cons of CAD are susceptible to change. CAD is still <strong>evolving</strong>, and with it, so too will its advantages and disadvantages. A decade down the line, who’s to say what CAD <strong>will</strong> or <strong>won’t</strong> be capable of?&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="future-of-cad"></a></p>
<h1><strong>The Future of CAD</strong></h1>
<p>So far we’ve managed to discuss the history of CAD, where it originated and how it progressed. We’ve even looked at the evolution of the technology and industries using it. But what exactly does the future hold for CAD? Check out the&nbsp;<strong>main trends</strong> that are set to explode in the next decade below.</p>
<h2><strong>Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Augmented Reality</strong> is technology that allows <strong>real-time visualization</strong> of CAD models in the real-world environment. Current AR software makes use of devices like smartphones or tablets—capturing the surroundings with a camera and placing a digital effect over it to view the model. Past successes in AR include <a href="https://www.pokemongo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon Go</a>—the trend that took everyone by surprise. AR has many applications for CAD, like allowing designers to view their CAD models from different angles before they’re even produced. Companies like <a href="https://www.augment.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Augment</a> have created apps that allow designers to view their 3D models from <strong>SketchUp</strong>, <strong>Revit</strong>, <strong>SolidWorks</strong> and other CAD software—see it in action below.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tluBuQqeIiI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Virtual Reality</strong>, by comparison, immerses a user in a <strong>simulated world</strong> using a headset. It has been extremely useful in the gaming community, with products like <strong>Oculus Rift</strong>, <strong>PlayStation VR</strong> and <strong>Samsung VR</strong>. It’s also been useful in CAD, allowing designers to interact with models directly. Companies like <a href="https://www.virtalis.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Virtalis</a> and <a href="https://www.mindeskvr.com/site/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mindesk</a> are working with CAD companies like <strong>Autodesk</strong> and <strong>SolidWorks</strong> to integrate VR into their software offerings. Autodesk is also looking to make its software <a href="https://news.autodesk.com/press-release/autodesk-consumer-group-and-education/autodesk-accelerates-future-digital-and-physical" target="_blank" rel="noopener">compatible</a> with Microsoft’s VR product <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HoloLens</a>, which will have an exciting impact on CAD.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3QyA7HhIYkg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Needless to say, AR/VR-driven CAD is a fascinating trend that could have <strong>huge repercussions</strong> in the design industry. In the future, designers might be able to send customers products that can be looked at in a real-world format using AR—before the product is even manufactured. In addition, designers might be able to run CAD software like <strong>SolidWorks</strong> or <strong>AutoCAD</strong> with a VR headset and essentially create models like virtual sculptures, completely by hand.</p>
<p>Of course, VR/AR has many steps to take before it’s perfect. One of the main issues with this technology is the need for<strong> headsets</strong>, which aren’t very practical or appealing to the consumer market.</p>
<h2><strong>Cloud in the Future</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Cloud-based CAD</strong> has already been reached by some CAD companies—with many more looking towards it in the near future. With this trend comes the possibility of never having to worry about software updates ever again. With cloud-based CAD, the software would be available in your browser, without the need for <strong>upgrades</strong> or <strong>downloads</strong>. In addition, issues like <strong>data management</strong> might even become obsolete. There’s no need to save several copies of a design or worry about overwritten data when your cloud-based CAD software is able to track everything you do.</p>
<h2><strong>Generative Design&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>A major upcoming trend in CAD is the concept of CAD technology being able to ‘<strong>think</strong>‘—anticipating a designer’s next move and making a reciprocating move accordingly. This is otherwise known as ‘<strong>Generative Design</strong>‘. Designers will soon be able to choose the best<strong> design solution</strong> by working alongside computers to create an <strong>ideal design</strong>. Autodesk is currently working on&nbsp;<a href="https://autodeskresearch.com/projects/dreamcatcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Catcher</a>—a program that can generate hundreds of unique designs in hours, as opposed to the days it can take a human to create a single design. This will surely have a huge impact on the CAD industry in the coming years.</p>

<h2><strong>Other Possibilities</strong></h2>
<p>Many anticipate a <strong>fully immersive</strong> 3D experience with CAD in the future. This may include modeling tools like&nbsp;<strong>special gloves</strong> and <strong>goggles</strong> (as opposed to headsets), making the process closer to sculpting than painting. There’s also the possibility of bringing <strong>voice commands</strong> into the fold. This would enable designers to draw and control CAD with their own voice. Of course, CAD requires a lot of precision, so a lot of work needs to be done to ensure that designers have the <strong>maximum accuracy</strong> required—whether it’s for touchscreen technology or voice commands. Essentially, the most important aspects of future CAD technology and software are <strong>ease</strong> and <strong>speed</strong>—it’s all about making the design process <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>convenient</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CAD has grown and changed radically over the years—and will only continue to do so with time.&nbsp;</p>
